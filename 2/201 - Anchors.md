# Anchors (Links)

The **anchor** (`<a>`) element is used to make links. In your html, try `<a href="https://google.com"> Google </a>`.

As you can see, the `<a>` creates a link. The `href` attribute says *where* the link will lead to, and the text between the opening and closing `<a>` tags determine what text the link will show (what it will look like).
