1. Create a new text file called 'index.html' and write 'Hello World' inside it. 
2. Open this file with Chrome by right-clicking the file and choosing 'Open With -> Google Chrome'.
3. In Chrome, you should see something like the following:

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/kN5XqOG.png'/>

Congratulations - you have just written your first minimal website / web app. 

Web apps and pages are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser (Chrome) knows how to 'show' the HTML page. Our current HTML page is very simple - it just has a single 'Hello World' line in it, but we'll quickly make it stronger.

Inside index.html, change the message to be:
  
    <div>Hello World3</div>


## Exercises
1. Change the text in index.html and refresh the browser page. Note how the page you see changes.
