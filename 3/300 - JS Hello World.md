# JS Hello World

JavaScript (or "JS" for short) is a programming language that the browser can run. 

JS adds interactivity to websites, changing them from web 'pages' to web 'apps'. 

We will start learning JavaScript by running it in the browser's *console*. Open Chrome's Developer Tools and switch from the Elements tab to the Console tab. This will open a JS *console* in which we can run code and see the results. 

Try running `alert('Hello World')`. Notice the pop-up.Congratulations - you have just written your first JavaScript.

Try running `console.log('Hello World 2')`. Notice the print-out in the console.
