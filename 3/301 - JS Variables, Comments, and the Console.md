# JS Assignment, Comments, and the Console

JS uses variables of a few types, declared by `var`. For example, try the following, pressing 'enter' after each line:

    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;
    var c = a + b;

You can enter code into the console and see the results. Here we are using the single '=' sign for assignment - after running this code, `a` will be equal to 1, `b` will be equal to 2, and `c` will be equal to 3. 

The console always returns and prints the value returned by any expression: You can enter just 'a' and receive the value of a. 

JS has comments, denoted by `//`. Anything after a `//` will be treated a comment and ignore. Try it in the console.

    var a = 1 // assigning 1 to 'a'

As you can see, comments are often used to explain what is happening, or what the result is. For example:

    var a = 1 // assign 1 to a
    var b = 2 // assign 2 to b
    var c = a + b // 3
