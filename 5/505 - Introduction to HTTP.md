# Introduction to HTTP

'HTTP' is the format in which a client usually talks to a server. The client makes an *HTTP Request* for a resource, such as an HTML / CSS / JS file, and the server responds. 

The same way a person might call a bakery and ask for a sandwich using *English*, a browser might call a server and ask for an HTML file using *HTTP*. 

A client can also make an HTTP request to *add* something to the server, for example to add a new blog post or comment. 

There are several different kinds of HTTP requests - the two most important ones are the 'GET' type and the 'POST' type. 

HTTP *GET* requests are used to retrieve information from the server; HTTP *POST* requests are used to update the server about something. 

GET - to get; POST - to set. So far this is just in theory, we'll soon see how it's used.
