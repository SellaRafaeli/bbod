# Online FE Code Editors 

It's good to experiment with your own local html file and scripts. However there are often benefits to having an *online* code editor, where you can paste your code and see the results. 

Some sites that do this are **jsbin.com**, **jsfiddle.net**, and **codepen.io**. Each of these sites lets you paste HTML, CSS and JS together - and shows you the result. This is a good way of experimenting, as well as sharing code with others. 

Often when someone wants to show how to do something in FE code, they use jsbin.
