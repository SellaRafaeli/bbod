# API

An **API** is a list of methods something like a server or an object exposes. For example, an object has a list of methods you call on it. When talking about a server, its API is the list of different URLs you can use to call. 

In our Example Backend, the api includes *routes* such as `GET /posts` and `POST /posts`. The first route return a list of posts; the second is used to add a new post. 

We can access the `GET /posts` route directly in the server by going to the `/posts` URL. Entering a URL into the browser sends a GET request to that url. We notice the response is a JSON object including a list of posts.
