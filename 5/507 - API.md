# API

An **API** is a list of methods something like a server or an object exposes. For example, an object has a list of methods you call on it. When talking about a server, its API is the list of different URLs you can use to call. 

In our Example Backend, the api includes the following *routes*:

    `GET /index.html` //return Index.html
    `GET /posts` //return a list of posts
    `POST /posts` //add a post
    `GET /users` //get a list of users
    `POST /users` //add a user

This is often how a server API might be described - a list of routes (sometimes called 'endpoints'); each route described by a verb (GET or POST) and a URL (/posts, /users, etc). A client can *call* any route, and each route does something different. Each route also returns some response, which can be either an HTML file, or a JSON piece of data. 

We can access the `GET /posts` route directly in the server by going to the `/posts` URL. Entering a URL into the browser sends a GET request to that url. We notice the response is a JSON object including a list of posts.
