# 1.0.0 - Hello World 

1. Create a new text file called 'index.html' and write 'Hello World' inside it. 
2. Open this file with Chrome by right-clicking the file and choosing 'Open With -> Google Chrome'.
3. In Chrome, you should see something like the following:

Congratulations - you have just written your first minimal website / web app. 

Web apps and pages are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser (Chrome) knows how to 'show' the HTML page. 

## Exercises

1. Change the text in index.html and refresh the browser page. Note how the page you see changes.

### JSFiddle

JSFiddle.com is Website which lets you paste code and shows you the result of that code.

For example in this link - https://jsfiddle.net/sellarafaeli/b0d94fv5/ - you can see a 'Hello World'. In the top left you can see the contents of the HTML file, and in the bottom right you can see the result as if you had run this in your browser. (The other two boxes are for CSS and JS, which we will discuss in the future). 

2. Open the link (https://jsfiddle.net/sellarafaeli/b0d94fv5/) and make sure you understand what's going on.

3. Change the text from 'Hello World' to 'Hello ' + (your name), for example 'Hello Joe', and click 'run' (or control+Enter) to see the result change. 

4. Click 'update' to create a link with the updated code (after you changes) in order to share with others. 

We will be using JSFiddle in order to show code (like HTML, in the top left) and its result (in the bottom right).
