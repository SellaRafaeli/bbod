# 1.0.6 - Chrome Dev Tools

The Chrome browser comes built-in with a set of developer tools which allow which allow for powerful inspection and debugging of web pages. 

You can open the developer tools by clicking right-click and 'Inspect Element' anywhere on the page. On Windows you can use F12 as a keyboard shortcut; on a Mac you can use cmd + alt + I. 

The developer tools has many features and is extremely useful in learning how our web page is built and debugging our code.

The first feature we will see is the **Elements Panel**, in which we can see the HTML elements of our page, and the **Styles** tab in which we can see the applied styles of the element we are currently looking at.

For example, we might see some thing like this:

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/aNJJFLA.jpg' />

We can edit the document directly from the Elements page - we can add, remove, or edit the HTML directly, as well as apply styles. We can thus 'play around' with our app, seeing the immediate results of our code. 

While building web pages/apps, we will use the Chrome Dev tools extensively. They are an extremely powerful tool.
