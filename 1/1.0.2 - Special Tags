# 1.0.2 - Special Tags

Other than content tags like <span> or <div>, browsers also know other HTML tags with some stronger functionality. Let's review a tags - and you try them out in your index.html. 

Strong text:

    <strong> Strong text </strong>

A button:

    <button> A button </button>

A dropdown select:

    <select>
      <option> Option 1 </option>
      <option> Option 2 </option>
    </select>

A text area input (multiline):
  
    <textarea></textarea>

A text input:

    <input />

Note the last element - the <input/> - is a *self-closing* tag; instead of having an opener and closer it has just a single tag which closes itself. 

You can see how the browser uses these elements to create the controls you are familiar with. There are *many* tags and we will gradually learn them. No rush.
