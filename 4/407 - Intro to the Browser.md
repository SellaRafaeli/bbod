# Intro to the Browser

By now we have enough knowledge to understand some of the important things the browser does. In general, the browser knows how to...

- show content from HTML, 
- style HTML with styles
- fetch CSS from external files (with the link tag)
- run JavaScript 
- fetch JavaScript from external files (with the script tag)
- show images
- fetch images from external files (with the img tag)

It's illuminating to see that we can use the browser to simply 'view' these external files separately, not just as part of the HTML. Try the following links in your browser:

- https://i.imgur.com/NJoZJIs.jpg (an image)
- https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js (a JavaScript file)
- https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css (a CSS file)

Each of these files - images, JS files, CSS - can be imported via an img / link / script tag. The browser will go to the address supplied, pull the source (as we can do manually), and inject it into the document. 

This is part of the many things the browser does - truly a remarkable piece of software.
